# Terminal Animator 📝🖋

> **A functional approach to animation.**

> This is built for animating videos with ASCII art.

You can make your own animations in the terminal using this library. However, it's still very in the works.

## To Do Features
- Sync audio and music together (Progress on this is the ms => frames function)

## How It Works

## Original Purpose
Built for animating ![Frums' Wavetapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lRPEny5jug), but I got extremely fed up with my spaghetti code. Thus, I made my own framework for animating.
